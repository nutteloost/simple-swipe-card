Simple Swipe Card is a customizable container for Home Assistant that lets you place multiple cards in a single space and navigate between them with intuitive swipe gestures. The card optimizes dashboard space by grouping related information while providing a mobile-friendly interface with smooth touch and mouse navigation. It features pagination indicators, adjustable card spacing, and full visual editor support. Ideal for creating room-specific views, device dashboards, or organizing related information without cluttering your dashboard, Simple Swipe Card enhances both functionality and user experience with minimal configuration.


## Features
- Swipe between multiple cards
- Pagination dots
- Configurable card spacing
- Visual editor support
- Loopback mode for continuous navigation
- Support for both horizontal and vertical swiping
- Automatic Slideshow (Auto-Swipe):
    - Cards can cycle automatically at a user-defined interval
    - Auto-swipe intelligently pauses during manual user interaction (e.g., manual swipe, pagination click) and resumes after 5 seconds (not configurable)
    - Integrates with Loopback Mode for continuous cycling or uses a "ping-pong" effect if loopback is disabled
- Reset After Timeout: Automatically return to a target card after inactivity
- State Synchronization: Two-way sync with Home Assistant input_select and input_number entities

### Example Configuration
```yaml
type: custom:simple-swipe-card
cards:
  - type: weather-forecast
    entity: weather.home
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - sensor.temperature
      - sensor.humidity
  - type: media-control
    entity: media_player.living_room
show_pagination: true
card_spacing: 15
enable_loopback: true
swipe_direction: horizontal
enable_auto_swipe: false
auto_swipe_interval: 3000
enable_reset_after: true
reset_after_timeout: 45000
reset_target_card: 1
state_entity: input_select.dashboard_cards
```

## State Synchronization

Simple Swipe Card can synchronize its current position with Home Assistant entities, enabling external control and automation integration through two-way binding.

### Supported Entities

**Input Select (`input_select`)**
- Options are mapped by position to visible cards (option 1 = card 1, option 2 = card 2, etc.)
- Changing the input_select value navigates to the corresponding card
- Swiping to a card automatically updates the input_select value

**Input Number (`input_number`)**
- Uses 1-based indexing where 1 = first card, 2 = second card, etc.
- Changing the input_number value navigates to the corresponding card
- Swiping to a card automatically updates the input_number value

### Option/Card Count Handling
- **More options than cards**: Extra options are ignored and cannot be selected.
- **Fewer options than cards**: Only cards corresponding to available options can be controlled externally. Cards without corresponding options can still be reached through manual swiping but won't update the entity.
- **Visibility conditions**: State synchronization works with visible cards only. If cards are hidden due to visibility conditions, the mapping adjusts automatically to match only the currently visible cards.

## Visibility Conditions

Individual cards within the Simple Swipe Card can be conditionally shown or hidden using visibility conditions. Multiple conditions use AND logic (all must be true).

> âš  **Important**: Visibility conditions are added to individual cards within your Simple Swipe Card configuration, not to the Simple Swipe Card configuration itself. 

## Customizing with Theme Variables

The Simple Swipe Card provides extensive customization capabilities through two primary methods: Home Assistant themes and card-mod styling. This flexible approach allows you to establish consistent styling across all card instances while maintaining the ability to customize individual cards as needed.

### Method 1: Home Assistant Themes

Apply styling globally across all instances of Simple Swipe Card by adding theme variables to your Home Assistant configuration. This method is ideal for maintaining consistent styling throughout your dashboard.

To apply these customizations, add them to your theme in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  themes:
    simple_swipe_theme:
      # Your existing theme properties
      primary-color: '#2196f3'
      
      # Simple Swipe Card customizations
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-color: '#ff5722'
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-size: '10px'
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-spacing: '6px'
      simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: '0.4s'
      simple-swipe-card-pagination-background: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
      # Add any other variables from the complete CSS reference
```

### Method 2: Card-Mod Styling

Apply styling directly to individual card instances using card-mod. This method provides maximum flexibility and allows for unique styling of specific cards. Card-mod styles take precedence over theme variables, enabling you to override global themes for specific instances.

```yaml
type: custom:simple-swipe-card
cards:
  - type: weather-forecast
    entity: weather.home
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - sensor.temperature
card_mod:
  style: |
    :host {
      --simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-color: #ff5722;
      --simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-size: 12px;
      --simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: 0.5s;
      /* Add any other variables from the complete CSS reference */
    }
```

### Available CSS Variables

All CSS variables listed below can be used in both Home Assistant themes and card-mod styling configurations. These variables provide comprehensive control over the visual appearance and behavior of the Simple Swipe Card.

```yaml
/* Pagination Dot Styling */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-size: 8px;                                   /* Diameter of inactive pagination dots */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-size: 8px;                            /* Diameter of the active pagination dot */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-color: var(--primary-color, #03a9f4); /* Color of the currently selected dot */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-inactive-color: rgba(127, 127, 127, 0.6);    /* Color of inactive pagination dots */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-spacing: 4px;                                /* Horizontal/vertical space between dots */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-border-radius: 50%;                              /* Border radius of dots (50% = circle) */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-active-opacity: 1;                           /* Opacity of the active pagination dot */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-dot-inactive-opacity: 1;                         /* Opacity of inactive pagination dots */

/* Pagination Container Styling */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-background: transparent;                         /* Background color of pagination container */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-padding: 4px 8px;                                /* Padding around the pagination dots */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-bottom: 8px;                                     /* Distance from bottom edge (horizontal mode) */
--simple-swipe-card-pagination-right: 8px;                                      /* Distance from right edge (vertical mode) */

/* Animation and Transition Effects */
--simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: 0.3s;                                     /* Duration of slide transition animations */
--simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: ease-out;                                /* Easing function for slide animations */
```

### Animation Customization Examples

You can use any valid CSS transition timing function for `simple-swipe-card-transition-easing`:

```yaml
# Example animation customizations
simple-swipe-card-transition-speed: '0.5s'                          # Slower animation
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'ease-in-out'                  # Smooth in and out
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)' # Material Design easing
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'linear'                       # Constant speed
simple-swipe-card-transition-easing: 'ease-in'                      # Slow start, fast end
```

### Styling Hierarchy

When both theme variables and card-mod styling are present, the following hierarchy applies:

1. Card-mod styles (highest priority)
2. Theme variables
3. Default card styling (lowest priority)

This hierarchy allows you to establish baseline styling through themes while maintaining the flexibility to customize individual card instances as needed.
